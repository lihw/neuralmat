## Introduction

Neural material has been a popular research area in recent years, with two major research directions. The first involves using neural networks to represent BRDF and incorporating the new representation into the renderer. The second direction focuses on optimizing the current BRDF data, e.g., BRDF compression and authoring workflow. This repository aims to gather all relevant papers, code and tools that can assit researchers in reproducing the results or creating their own proof-of-concepts. Additionally, we may provide a all-in-one GUI tool in the future to consolidate all these resources like NerfStudio.

## Algorithms

As previously mentioned, we have categorized all recent neural material advances into two groups. 

### Optimizing BRDF materials

- Algorithm 1: Brief description and key features
- Algorithm 2: Brief description and key features

### Neural BRDF

- Algorithm 3: Brief description and key features
- Algorithm 4: Brief description and key features

## Installation

For instructions on installation of each algorithm, please refer to their respective documentation.

## Contributing

Explain how others can contribute to your project. For example:

1. Fork the project
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/AmazingFeature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some AmazingFeature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/AmazingFeature`)
5. Open a pull request
